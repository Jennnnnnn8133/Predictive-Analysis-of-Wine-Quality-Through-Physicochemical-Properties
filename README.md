## Data 319 Final Group Project

### Group 9 Project Members:
- Halina Kuczynski (11786333)
- Jenny Cheng (11678647)
- Kyle Risso (11773294)

## Dataset
[UC Irvine Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)

## Project Overview:
Our group conducted a comprehensive analysis of the "Wine Quality" dataset to explore the relationships between physicochemical properties and wine quality. This dataset includes both red and white wines, featuring 12 columns with unique physicochemical properties, and the last column represents the wine quality rating on a base 10 scale.

### Research Questions:
1. How do specific physicochemical properties contribute to the overall quality rating of red and white wines?
2. Can multivariate analysis methods help identify patterns or clusters within the dataset that correlate with high or low-quality wines?

## Project Components:

### Dimension Reduction (PCA):
We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore the dataset's inherent structure and reduce its dimensionality, identifying key components that contribute most to the variation in wine quality.

### Clustering (Hierarchical):
Hierarchical clustering was utilized to group wines with similar characteristics, providing insights into potential quality-related patterns.

### Correlation Matrix:
A correlation matrix was constructed and analyzed to understand relationships between different physicochemical properties.

### ROC Curve:
We evaluated the performance of our classification algorithm using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to quantify overall performance.

### Factor Analysis:
We derived a heatmap from factor analysis, providing insights into associations between observed physicochemical properties and underlying latent factors.

### Multivariate Normal Modeling:
We selected columns for comparison with a multivariate normal distribution, assessing the normality of physicochemical properties.

## Evaluation:
Our analysis effectively addressed the research questions, providing nuanced insights into the physicochemical properties influencing wine quality. The methodology, results, and conclusions are detailed in the project report.

## Preliminary Outline Statement:
Our preliminary outline statement reflects our current thoughts and considerations as we approach the project. As we progress, we will refine our research questions and dataset choices based on further exploration and group discussions.

## Project Proposal:
Our project proposal outlines the motivation, dataset description, research questions, multivariate methods, initial observations, and expected individual contributions. This plan guides our analysis of wine quality using the selected dataset.

### Expected Individual Contributions:
- **Halina:** Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- **Jenny:** Implementation of multivariate methods and ROC curve, confusion matrix heat map, factor analysis, and multivariate normal modeling.
- **Kyle:** Statistical analysis, script execution, and Hierarchical clustering.

## Acknowledgments:
We acknowledge the UC Irvine for providing the "Wine Quality" dataset for our analysis.
